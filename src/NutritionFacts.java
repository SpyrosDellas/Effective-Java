/**
 * This class demonstrates the Builder pattern.
 *
 * <p> Instead of making the desired object directly, the client calls a constructor
 * (or static factory) with all of the required parameters and
 * gets a builder object.
 * Then the client calls setter-like methods on the builder object
 * to set each optional parameter of interest.
 * Finally, the client calls a parameterless build method to generate the object, which is typically
 * immutable.
 * The builder is typically a static member class of the class it builds.
 * <p>
 * In summary, the Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes
 * whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of
 * parameters, especially if many of the parameters are optional or of identical type.
 * Client code is much easier to read and write with builders than with telescoping
 * constructors, and builders are much safer than JavaBeans.
